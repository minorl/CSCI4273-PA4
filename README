Compile:
$ make

Run:
-Run process-per-protocol host:
 $ ./ppprunner <local port> <remote host> <remote port>
-Run process-per-message host:
 $ ./ppmrunner <local port> <remote host> <remote port>
-Timed run
 $ ./time <host1> <host2> [<number of runs>]

Program compiles and runs without error.

Timings (averaged over 10 runs):

Per-process hosts:
	586 ms

Per-message hosts:
    1194 ms

Mixed hosts:
    528 ms

Results seem weird, but that's a result of the implementation:
-In the process per message model, there's a mutex and a single count variable tracking the number of messages received. This creates a choke point.
