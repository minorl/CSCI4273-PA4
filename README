To compile the program with driver1-3
make all
to run
./test-*

Everything works to my knowledge. 
ThreadPool:
	Producer/consumer. Required ot have a "thread available" boolean, so added a count to keep track of this. Not necessary.
	Thread pool exit makes sure all threads finish before exiting.
Message:
	This uses the char* pointers and DOES NOT DO A DEEP COPY. If buffers used to initialize messages are edited, BEHAVIOR WILL NOT BE CORRECT
Scheduler:
	This is awful. Assumed time in schedule event was in ms.
